This is a clone of Street Fighter made from scratch in Java. To knock out the other player, the player has a multitude of attacks at their disposal, each with their own unique sound effects, damage, and stunning effects.

-----------------------------------------------------

My game includes player versus player and player versus AI modes, where each player controls the character using the same keyboard, configured in the options menu. Each match is in a best of 3 format, where the player that knocks out the other twice wins. For the player versus AI mode, called 'Story', I created a simple AI player that uses random number generation to decide which moves to use. These moves are limited to the AI's current stance, so that the AI doesn't use a jumping attack while crouched, for example. This makes the AI quite erratic, so somewhat hard to defeat.

-----------------------------------------------------


There are 3 types of attack: light, medium, and heavy. These can be used whilst standing, crouched, moving forward, moving backward, or jumping for different effects, ranges, and speeds. There are 6 characters to choose from, each with their own set of animations, which are all taken from the real games. Every match, a random background is chosen to emulate the change in location from the real games. The game has sounds for hitting the opponent, and music from the real games.

I have included my final report in this repository, which acts as a manual for the game and includes all work conducted for the whole project.

The following videos are extended versions of the GIFs shown earlier, and give a full view of the gameplay experience:
